# Pre-flight DNS in PDF readers

This repo contains some research into preflight DNS-queries in PDF readers, i.e. DNS queries made by simply opening the document.
In short, from the tests used in this repo, only Firefox makes DNS queries without any user interaction.
This could, in theory, be used for fingerprinting and/or de-anonymization of users.
